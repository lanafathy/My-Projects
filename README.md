# 👩‍💻 Lana Fathy | Network and Cybersecurity Student

Welcome! I’m Lana — a second-year CS student specializing in **Networks** and **Cybersecurity**. I explore everything from data link layers and wireless protocols to encryption algorithms and secure key exchanges. Whether it’s simulating a network or implementing AES from scratch, I love digging into the *why* behind the *how*.
